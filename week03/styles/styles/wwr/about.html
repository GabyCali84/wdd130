        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Fantastic!
          This was my first time going white water rafting and it was so much fun! 
          The river is great but what sets this place apart was the Tour Guides. 
          These guys are hilarious but still fantastic professionals. If you want to have a blast, ask for David.</p>
